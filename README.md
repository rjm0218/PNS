PNS Companion 

Project Name: PNS Companion App
This project provides a web application for planning and managing building upgrades in a sanctuary-style game (or similar). It allows users to plan upgrades, estimate resource costs, and track progress.

Features:

Building Planning: Users can select a target building and level to view the required resources for the upgrade.
Resource Cost Estimation: The application calculates the total resource costs, considering existing buildings and account-specific boosts (heroes, builder gear).
Account Management: Users can select their account to personalize resource calculations.
Sanctuary Overview: A comprehensive overview of the user's sanctuary, allowing for easy tracking of building levels and upgrades.
Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes for optimal usability.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: React, React Bootstrap, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB), Express Validator, JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Database: MongoDB
Architecture:

The application follows a client-server architecture. The frontend (React) handles user interaction and displays data. The backend (Node.js/Express.js) handles data fetching, calculations, and database interactions. JWTs are used for authentication and authorization.
